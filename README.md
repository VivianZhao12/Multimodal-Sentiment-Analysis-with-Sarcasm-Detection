# Advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Sarcasm Detection

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an advanced multimodal sentiment analysis model that incorporates both audio and text data inputs to detect underlying sentiments. A particular focus is on enhancing the ability of pre-existing models to identify sarcasm. Conventional sentiment analysis models often misclassify sarcastic text as positive without understanding the subtext. By integrating audio cues, which may convey negativity or dissonance with the textual sentiment, our model seeks to accurately detect sarcasm and thereby improve the overall accuracy of sentiment classification.

## Approach

We propose to train an additional model specifically for identifying sarcasm. This sarcasm model will be used in the classification step of conventional multimodal sentiment models to enhance their accuracy in detecting sarcasm.

### Key Features:

Multimodal Inputs: Integration of both audio and text data for a comprehensive analysis.

Sarcasm Detection: Focused on overcoming challenges in identifying sarcasm through additional training on sarcasm-specific datasets.

Improved Accuracy: Incorporating audio cues for dissonance to refine sentiment classifications.

Intuition and Originality

Our approach aims to outperform existing methods by leveraging multimodal data and incorporating sarcasm detection to better capture complex emotions. By explicitly detecting sarcasm and analyzing sentiment shifts, our pipeline ensures more robust sentiment predictions through the integration of text and audio modalities, which provides a richer context for training.

### Key Highlights:

Sarcasm-Specific Dataset: Manual collection of a dataset meticulously designed to capture the nuances of sarcasm and tone, enabling better model training with high-quality data.

State-of-the-Art Models: Leveraging advanced feature engineering, such as sentence-level similarity and sentiment shifts, combined with efficient multimodal fusion techniques.

Originality: Addressing sarcasm as a confounding factor in sentiment analysis, with a robust pipeline designed for nuanced emotion detection.
